A zombie apocalypse Minecraft Plugin

# Hello Everyone!

This was a small project I worked on during Christmas of 2020. I had a lot of fun learning about Java and how to create plugins. 

## What it does, how it works, and how to beat it:
1. You spawn in a peaceful world and are given 3 in-game days (about an hour) to gather materials. During this time period, monsters are not allowed to spawn. Note that sleeping in your bed does not affect the timer.
2. After the three days are over, the world will automatically turn dark and monsters will begin to spawn. There will be no more sunlight from this point onwards. The monsters spawn depending on your location and light level.
3. As time progresses, the monsters that get spawned in will vary and get tougher and tougher.
4. In each dimention (overworld, end, nether), different types of mobs will spawn.
5. The objective is to beat the game (Which means going to the end and going back to the overworld).

## How to set it up:
